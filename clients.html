      <h3 class="center">Champion</h3>
      <p>I was the sole content curator and social media manager for Champion Australia and New Zealand on a four month contract working alongside my agency, iD Collective. In this time I successfully grew Champion's Instagram account by more than 1100 new followers per month, seeing the account grow from 5,300 followers to 10.2k followers in the time that I managed Champion's Instagram account. Champion have quite a few restrictions surrounding the type of content that I was allowed to post on their Instagram account, so I spent a portion of my time growing Champion's Instagram account via organic engagement.

      <h3 class="center">Rice Workshop</h3>
      <p>I was the content curator and social media manager for one of Melbourne's well known Japanese restaurants, Rice Workshop. As part of my role as social media manager, I designed and implented a 6 month social media plan, directed photoshoots, curated Rice Workshop's Instagram feed and also managed Rice Workshop's Instagram and Facebook accounts. Rice Workshop's brand is quite ecclectic and bright, which allowed me to have quite a lot of creative freedom when directing our monthly content shoots.

    <p>In addition to running front of house for this popular Perth cafe, I was also Shortlist's sole content creator and social media manager.

      <h3 class="center">Debenham's Australia</h3>
      <p>I worked alongside a talented photographer to create and curate a stylish feed that reflected Debenham's up-market branding. Each month I planned out and directed product shoots, in conjunction with running their Instagram and Facebook accounts. In addition to this, I also worked alongside Debenham's marketing manager to execute a long term marketing plan that we had both collectively implemented. My role saw me communicating our marketing goals to my content creator in order to ensure that the branding and aesthetic of Debenham's Instagram account remained on brand.

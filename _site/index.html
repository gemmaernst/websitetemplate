    <h2> A Little Bit About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, my name is Gemma Ernst and I am an Australian born creative now based in Bali. I've been in the industry for 5 and a half years, mostly working with agencies, but truth be told...I'm all about the independant innovators and entrepenuers! I am all for helping start ups find their feet within the digital world and providing them with the means to leverage themselves into the industry without spending a small fortune whilst doing so. Be it web design, content marketing, or managing your social media channels, I’ll help you focus in on the areas that can make a real difference to you and your business.
    To get to the true personality of your brand, I work with you not without you .</p>

    <h3>Social Media Management</h3>
    <p>Social media can be overwhelming at the best of times; between posting, liking, keeping up with DMs and comments...it's easy to let your Instagram account slip into the dark when you've got a million other business related things going on in your brain. This is where I come in! I will help you de-clutter your mind, and will take all of the stress of growing and managing your social media accounts, leaving you to deal with the forefront of your business.</p>
